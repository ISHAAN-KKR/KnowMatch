# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Model Details

### Model Description
- **Model Type:** Sentence Transformer
- **Base model:** [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) <!-- at revision c9745ed1d9f207416be6d2e6f8de32d1f16199bf -->
- **Maximum Sequence Length:** 256 tokens
- **Output Dimensionality:** 384 dimensions
- **Similarity Function:** Cosine Similarity
<!-- - **Training Dataset:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **Language:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **License:** Unknown -->

### Model Sources

- **Documentation:** [Sentence Transformers Documentation](https://sbert.net)
- **Repository:** [Sentence Transformers on GitHub](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers)
- **Hugging Face:** [Sentence Transformers on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers)

### Full Model Architecture

```
SentenceTransformer(
  (0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 256, 'do_lower_case': False}) with Transformer model: BertModel 
  (1): Pooling({'word_embedding_dimension': 384, 'pooling_mode_cls_token': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_tokens': True, 'pooling_mode_max_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_weightedmean_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_lasttoken': False, 'include_prompt': True})
  (2): Normalize()
)
```

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the 🤗 Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    'Idea: A fintech tool for rural banking | Ownership: Technology & Product | Personality: Empathetic, Detail-Oriented, Strategic thinker | Stage: MVP launched | Vision: Solve a niche problem and sustain profitably | Work Style: Lead-follow dynamic, Collaborative brainstorming | Pivot Openness: 4/5',
    'Interests: Technology & AI, Social Impact | Ownership: Technology & Product, Other | Personality: I notice the small things and like getting things right, I care about people and their needs, I like analyzing problems before acting | Stage: I want to scale something that already has users | Vision: I want to help solve a real problem and make a difference | Work Style: I adapt to whatever the team needs, I enjoy bouncing ideas and brainstorming together | Pivot Openness: 1/5',
    "Interests: Art & Creativity, Technology & AI | Ownership: People & Community, Specialized Knowledge | Personality: I get things done quickly, I notice the small things and like getting things right, I think big and love imagining future possibilities | Stage: I prefer joining when there's a prototype to build on | Vision: I'm exploring and learning what I enjoy | Work Style: I'm okay with following a clear leader, I like having my own space to work independently | Pivot Openness: 3/5",
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 384]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities.shape)
# [3, 3]
```
